        It doesn't matter if the course is public, private, a par 3 or an
        executive course. The Four Attributes are ambiguous on purpose so that
        the unique characteristics of all Courses can be captured.

      <h1>Some tips to guide you in your Rating 📈</h1>
      <ul>
        <h3>Bang For Your Buck 💰</h3>
        <p>
          Do they have an Incredible Membership Deal? Or one that you just hope
          you can earn your savings on? How is the price without that membership
          deal?
        </p>
        <h3>Atmosphere 😎</h3>
        <p>
          How are the Vibes? Do you feel like the Golf Pro and staff are hawking
          over your shoulder every move you make? Or are you greeted at the
          first tee with a chilled Rum Shot? 🍹
        </p>
        <h3>Amenities 🍻</h3>
        <p>
          How is the practice facillity? Do they have great food and beverage
          options? Do they offer worthwile lessons and training? Does the course
          hold tournaments or other cool events such as 'Night Golf'? 🏌️‍♂️
        </p>
        <h3>Course Quality ⛳️</h3>
        <p>
          How are the greens rolling? Can you blame the greens or are you just a
          terrible putter? Is the rough and grass around the greens well kept?
          Is there sand at the beach? 🏝
        </p>
      </ul>
